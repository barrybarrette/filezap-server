This project is in very early development. The goal is to create a very simple temporary file storage platform that will allow users to send arbitrary files from their mobile device and then access them via a web browser on any device. This project is the backend service that will handle user management and file storage. There will be an accompanying app for Android (also IOS maybe in the future) that has a very simple interface via the share menu allowing you to quickly and easily upload photos, videos, or any arbitrary file.
